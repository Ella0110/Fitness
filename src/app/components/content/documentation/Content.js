          All of the components in Tailwind UI are designed for the latest
          version of Tailwind CSS, which is currently Tailwind CSS v3.4. To make
          sure that you are on the latest version of Tailwind, update via npm:
        </p>
        <pre className="language-bash">
          <code className="language-bash">
            <span className="token function">npm</span>{" "}
            <span className="token function">install</span> tailwindcss@latest
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          All of the examples in Tailwind UI rely on the default Tailwind CSS
          configuration, but some rely on additional first-party plugins like{" "}
          <code>@tailwindcss/forms</code>, <code>@tailwindcss/typography</code>,
          and <code>@tailwindcss/aspect-ratio</code>.
        </p>
